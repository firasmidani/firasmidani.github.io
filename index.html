      <p1> As a scientist at Baylor College of Medicine, I conduct cutting-edge research on the 
	      interactions between diet and the human gut microbiome, and their profound impact 
	      on human health. My current research focuses on the impact of nutrition on microbial 
	      infections and gut-brain interactions. I employ an interdisciplinary approach to my 
	      research, drawing on expertise in microbiology, microbial ecology, bioinformatics, 
	      and machine learning.  I received 
	   my <a href="https://genome.duke.edu/education/CBB">PhD in Computational 
	   Biology and Bioinformatics</a>  from Duke University in the 
	   <a href="http://el.ladlab.org:8080">Lawrence David lab</a>. 
	   I am currently an assistant professor in the 
	   <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/robert-britton">Britton lab</a> 
	   at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.
