      <p1> As a biologist, I am interested in the crosstalk between diet and human gut microbiome 
	      and how they impact health and disease. I received my PhD in Computational Biology 
	      from Duke University in the Lawrence David lab and I am currently a postdoctoral 
	      fellow in the Robert Britton lab at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. 
	      My current projects include identifying metabolic traits that may have contributed to 
	      the emergence of outbreak variants of Clostridioides difficile, understanding how the 
	      gut microbiome responds to dietary sugars, and leveraging machine learning approaches for analysis 
	      of high-throughput experiments. I received my <a href="https://genome.duke.edu/education/CBB">
