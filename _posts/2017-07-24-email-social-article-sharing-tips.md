###Macros and citation styles to improve efficacy of sharing and discussing research articles.

Scientific research has been moving at a very past face. So it is no wonder that scientists suffer from information over-load. Most of us have endless queues of papers to read and penchance to stay on top of broad body of research. This is both a product of incredible force of talented people working on interesting ideas and a publishing workhorse that churns out hundrends of papers a day. So, how can you effectively stay on top of the literature? 

I personally benefit from scientific colleagues who share interesting work with me and scientists on social media who disseminate and highlight awesome papers. However, colleagues often share work haphazardly and fail to highlight what's important about something that they  share. Likewise, folks on social media share plenty of articles without commenting on their value and impact. 

Yet, do not despair. There are several simple but impactful things that you can to do magnify your efforts of disseminating whether directly to your colleagues or to an online community. One of the most iconic scientists who is great at this is Eric Topol, Director of the Salk Translational Science Institute. On Twitter, [@EricTopol](https://twitter.com/EricTopol?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) has 120,000 followers and is well-renown for sharing highlights of translational research with poignant statements about their impact.
