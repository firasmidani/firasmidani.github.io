Scientific research moves at a very fast pace. It is not surprising why most scientists suffer from information overload. We often have a desire to stay on top of broad areas of interest which leads to endless queues of papers to read. This is both a product of a large scientific talent working on interesting ideas and an expansive publishing powerhouse that churns out hundreds of papers daily. So, how can you effectively stay on top of the literature? 

Many of us benefit from scientific colleagues who share relevant work with us and social media icons who disseminate and highlight interesting papers. However, folks often share work haphazardly whether one-on-one or to a large audience. **Almost everyone has received an email from a friend titled "paper of interst" with a lonely URL in the message.** Some of these article are in fact useful to our research while others leave us thinking why it was shared with us in the first place. 

While we cannot control how scientific research is shared with us, we can be better colleagues by sharing work in more expressive fashion. **There are simple habits to adopt that can magnify your effort of sharing interesting research to your colleagues or an online community.** I will illustrate these habits by highlighting the work of a famous scientist and online persona and by demonstraing how I personally do this in email communication. 

[@EricTopol](https://twitter.com/EricTopol?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), Director of the Salk Translational Science Institute,  is well-renown on Twitter for sharing highlights of translational research with succinct statements about their impact which is probably why he has 120,000 followers. Below is an example on how he does this so well and what makes it work. 

* Multiple panels of figures and text embedded in a tweet.
* Abstract included in one of the panels with  highlights of key words and sentences. 
* Self-explanatory figures that support highlighted claims in the paper. 
* Discussion with highlights of the impact of the paper in one of the panels.
* Succinct summary with keywords of the paper in the text of the tweet.

The overall result of this strategy is that a reader understands the gist and nuances of a paper in a handful of clicks and a couple of minutes. In return, Eric gets to scan the literature, record it, and intelligently retain it for his own personal use. 

Earlier in 2017, I began implementing some of those tricks when sharing work with colleagues. To make this process more streamlined, I invested some upfront effort to create a pipeline that makes this possible. Whenever I come across interesting work that I would like to save and share with others, I have three basic (and obvious) steps to follow: 

(1) add article to citation manager
(2) copy detailed description (and optionally annotations) of work 
(3) paste highlights of work in outgoing message

All you need to do this is your favorite reference manager. Ideally, it will have a browser plug-in that allows you to save a research article in your library with a single click on your broswer. I personally use `Zotero` for which I set-up a keyboard shortcut to quickly copy description of a item in my library into my Clipboard [^copyitem]. However, your reference manager would probably copy an item using default citation style. If I were to copy the citation with the American Anthropological Association style, you would get something like this. 

>Mallon, Cyrus A., Franck Poly, Xavier Le Roux, et al.<br/>2015 Resource Pulses Can Alleviate the Biodiversity–invasion Relationship in Soil Microbial Communities. Ecology 96(4): 915–926.

This is definitely a lot better than a URL. However, **you can easily create and adopt a custom-made style that will allow you to convey more information about the article**. To do this, I used the citation for the American Anthropological Association as a template and modified it to highlight the first two authors, last author, title, journal, web link, and abstract in an aesthetically pleasing format. My new citation style would now provide the following with a simple click.

>CA Mallon, F Poly, … JF Salles<br />**Resource Pulses Can Alleviate the Biodiversity–invasion Relationship in Soil Microbial Communities**<br />2015. *Ecology*. https://doi.org/10.1890/14-1001.1
<br /> The roles of species richness, resource use, and resource availability are central to many hypotheses explaining the diversity–invasion phenomenon but are generally not investigated together. Here, we created a large diversity gradient of soil microbial communities by either assembling communities of pure bacterial strains or removing the diversity of a natural soil. Using data on the resource-use capacities of the soil communities and an invader that were gathered from 71 carbon sources, we quantified the niches available to both constituents by using the metrics community niche and remaining niche available to the invader. A strong positive relationship between species richness and community niche across both experiments indicated the presence of resource complementarity. Moreover, community niche and the remaining niche available to the invader predicted invader abundance well. This suggested that increased competition in communities of higher diversity limits community invasibility and underscored the importance of resource availability as a key mechanism through which diversity hinders invasions. As a proof of principle, we subjected selected invaded communities to a resource pulse, which progressively uncoupled the link between soil microbial diversity and invasion and allowed the invader to rebound after nearly being eliminated in some communities. Our results thus show that (1) resource competition suppresses invasion, (2) biodiversity increases resource competition and decreases invasion through niche preemption, and (3) resource pulses that cannot be fully used, even by diverse communities, are favorable to invasion.

Now, I can paste the above in a new draft in my email client, use its native tools to highlights sentences or words in the abstract, and comment on the article by simple or rich text. I can also capture images from the PDF of the article in my library with `Grab` (or any other screen capture tool), and paste it directly into my outgoing message.   In short, I end up skimming the article, summarizing it, saving it in my library, and sharing it with colleagues who would benefit from it in a handful of minutes.

For papers that I read in depth, I often include highlights of the document directly into my message as text. I can not give a good advice on how best to do this. There are many different applications for annotating articels and they all differ in how they export annotations.  For example, [Walton Jones](http://jones.kaist.edu/notebook/2012/09/an-academic-notetaking-workflow.html) demonstrates how to interface with `Skim`  using `AppleScript` to export document annotations into formatted text. I personally have been using `Diigo`, a web-based boomkarking tool that allows for in-browser highlights and annotations of web articles and PDFs.  In my web interface, I can access the annotations then simply copy and paste them into my outgoing message. Here is what the final product would look like in an email message.

I have been sharing articles with colleagues and friends for many years using different but crude approaches. However, **I have adopted this apporach in 2017 [^update], and I have noticed that the recipients are more likely to respond with feedback and comments and I am more likely to absorb and contextualize articles that I save in my library **. I will admit that I occasionally do not follow these suggestions but I make a good effort to do so and it pays off in very marginal ways and often in the long-term. 

[^copyitem]:  In `Zotero`,  go to `Preferences`. Click on `Advanced` section then `Shortcuts` tab. Choose your keyboard shortcut for `Copy Selected Items to Clipboard`.
